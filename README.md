This repostory contain the run scripts for the conference paper "Simulation of reactive transport in fractured geothermal reservoir" by Shin Irgens Banshoya, Inga Berre and Eirik Keilegavlen (all at Dept. of Mathematics, UiB).  

The implementation uses version 1.5.0 of PorePy.
Additionally, some functionalities in PorePy were modified, which can be found in the folder "modified_porepy". These may or may not be a part of later versions of Porepy (for whatever reason).
