This repository contains the run scripts for the conference paper "Simulation of reactive transport in fractured geothermal reservoir" by Shin Irgens Banshoya, Inga Berre and Eirik Keilegavlen (all at Dept. of Mathematics, UiB).  

The implementation uses version 1.5.0 of PorePy.
Additionally, some functionalities in PorePy were modified. To get these, pull the branch modified_discretization_matrices, commit dd37db2c9c403ba9d0eca734eacfc40031bbac02. These may or may not be a part of later versions of the develop-branch of Porepy (for whatever reason).
